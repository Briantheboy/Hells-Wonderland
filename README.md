# Hells-Wonderland
An intense Quake multiplayer map for 2-4 players

After many setbacks, the greybox for Hell's Wonderland is finally complete. All the elements from the original 2D map layout are present, with a few alterations to improve quality. The only aspect of the map that has not been implemented yet are the teleporters. After several ongoing issues I encountered using the teleporters, I decided to exempt them from this version of the greybox. I hope to add them in in the coming days.
