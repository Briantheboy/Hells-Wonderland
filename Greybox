After many setbacks, I have finally managed to create a greybox of "Hell's Wonderland". I decided to follow my original 2D drawing of the map for a majority of the greybox,
but went ahead and made changes where I saw fit. Most of my stage's elements are present, except for the teleporters unfortunately. I will be sure to update my greybox as soon
as I can get them working.
